## About

A web Application for securely managing a To Do list.

[Full Requirements](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/todo/)

## Phase 1

- Refactor the starter code
- Modularize the application into separate components
- Style the application using the [Blueprint Component API](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/#blueprint)
- Implement the Context API to make some basic applications setting available to components
  - how many to do items to show at once
  - whether or not to show completed items

## Phase 2

- Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components
  - How many To Do Items to show at once
  - Whether or not to show completed items
- Provide the users with a form where they can change the values for those settings
  - This should be given in the form of a new component, perhaps linked to from the main navigation
  - Hint: Use Browser Router to create the page/route/component for this
